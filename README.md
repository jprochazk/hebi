# Hebi

This repository hosts a dynamically typed language, its compiler, and VM.

ðŸš§ This branch contains a rewrite of the language. It is currently heavily WIP! ðŸš§

## Usage

Install the library (currently only available via git):

```
$ cargo add --git https://github.com/jprochazk/hebi.git hebi
```

Import it, and run some code:

```rust
use hebi::Hebi;

fn main() {
  let mut hebi = Hebi::new();

  println!("1 + 1 = {}", hebi.eval("1 + 1").unwrap());
}
```

Hebi can do much more than this, though! Here are some of its features:

- Syntax similar to Python, including significant indentation
- First-class functions
- Classes with single inheritance
- Easy Rust function and struct binding
- Async support

Visit the [examples](./examples) directory to see Hebi in action.

You can run an example using `cargo run --example <name>`:
```
$ cargo run --example basic
```

## Development

The first step is to install Rust and Cargo via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### xtask

This repository uses [cargo-xtask](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) for various utilities, scripts, and tasks. That means you don't need anything other than Rust and Cargo. No makefiles, Python, or Bash.

To see all available tasks, run:
```
$ cargo xtask
```

To run one of them, use:
```
$ cargo xtask <task>
```

Or the slightly shorter:
```
$ cargo x <task>
```

For example:
```
# Run all tests and examples
$ cargo xtask test
```

Some tasks use tools which you'll have to install, though these are kept to just a select few, and ideally always installed through either `rustup` or `cargo`.

- [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) (`rustup +nightly component add miri`)
- [Insta](https://insta.rs/) (`cargo install --locked cargo-insta`)
- [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) (`cargo install --locked mdbook`)

## Why Hebi?

I thought it was appropriate, because the language is in the Python family, and Hebi (è›‡) means snake in Japanese.
