- finish writing tests for fn declarations and call exprs (kw params, param default values, closures)
- classes + method call + bound methods
- indexing ops split out from the VM (might become a trait, should be used for making it easier to deal with dict[key] vs list[key] vs class[key] etc.)
- iterator protocol + range-based loop using iterators (for v in obj) (blocked by meta methods)
- yield (and generators)
- modules and import
- native functions/classes/modules and a nice API for creating and exposing them to Mu-land 
- meta methods
