- [x] remove `__miri` feature and put args in `xtask miri` instead (`--filter` for running only specific tests)
  - [x] should unlock `--all-features`
- [x] change ptr repr to use manual vtable + static object trait
- [x] remove Table `named_field`, it should be reserved for methods
- [x] move all field access/index access/etc. to delegate to the object trait
- [ ] vm fully async
  - [x] stackless import
  - [ ] stackless class init
    - [ ] make `init` a contextual keyword that doesn't require `fn` in classes
    - [ ] user cannot access initializer (to call it again)
          only way is to call the class type
    - [ ] remove `super.init()` and replace with calling the proxy (`super()`)
- [x] fix `from m import a, b, c` bug
- [x] unify globals/global
- [x] remove `Ref` from name of public value types (inner should be prefix by `Owned` or qualified path)
- [x] fix `scope.params` will panic if given the wrong number of args
- [x] comma between disassembly operands
- [x] rename `emit` to `codegen`
- [x] print to configurable writer
- [x] allow printing disassembly (add option to compile snippet and explicitly run it -> expose `disassemble` on it)
- [x] list indexing
- [x] list index oob should return None instead of error (improve error message)
- [x] to_index should check MIN_SAFE_INT
- [ ] ops on builtins
- [x] methods on builtins
- [x] for iter loops (list)
- [ ] fix "invalid indentation" errors in parser which should be more specific

- [ ] debugger
  - egui
  - inspect state of VM
    - call frames
    - stack, accumulator
    - pretty-print values (using Debug)
  - step through bytecode (not necessarily source code)

- [ ] tuples
- [ ] generators
- [ ] f-strings
- [ ] `is`
- [ ] `in`
- [ ] exceptions (try/catch)
  - [ ] script-land inheritable error type
- [ ] inherit from native class
- [ ] report code locations (intern spans, track in hashmap of `offset->span_id`)
- [ ] timeout feature (abort signal, `Arc<AtomicBool>` or similar)
- [ ] semicolons (`;` for stmt, `;;` for block)
- [ ] codegen optimizations
  - [ ] dead code elimination (using basic blocks)
  - [ ] constant pool compaction
  - [ ] elide previous instruction for clobbered reads
  - [ ] peephole previous 2 instructions
    - [ ] load + store -> mov
    - [ ] load_field + call -> invoke
    - [ ] (load_smi 1) + add -> add1
  - [ ] specializations
    - [ ] load rN -> loadN, for N in 0 to some max bound
    - [ ] store rN -> storeN, for N in 0 to some max bound
- [ ] inspect dispatch loop codegen (should be a jump table)
- [ ] inline caching
  - per-function IC
  - reserve IC slot in codegen
- [ ] quickening
